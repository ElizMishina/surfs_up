## Overview of the statistical analysis:
### The purpose of the analysis
* The purpose of this analysis is to see the best time to open a surfe shop in Hawaii. Because the first few months are vital for the shop to survive openeing during a season where surfing will be limited is not ideal. Thus by analyzing the weather we are trying to find the best time to catch some waves.

## Results:
### There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December.
As shown in the [June_statistics](https://github.com/ElizMishina/surfs_up/blob/master/results/June.png) and the [December_statistics](https://github.com/ElizMishina/surfs_up/blob/master/results/December.png) as well as the [June_precipitation_statistics](https://github.com/ElizMishina/surfs_up/blob/master/results/June_percipitation.png) and the [December_precipitation_statistics](https://github.com/ElizMishina/surfs_up/blob/master/results/December_precipitation.png) there are quite a few differences in the weather:
* the temperature on average is higher in June by 3 degrees
* the precipitation is higher on average in decmber then it is in Jun
* the minimum temp in june is 8 degrees higher then it is in December

## Summary:
Over all if one would start a Surf Shop the chance of it surviving are much greater in June then it is in December. As shown in the statistic analyses above the Temperature is higher and the percipitation rate is lower, meaning more sunny warm days to spend at the beach Surfing.
